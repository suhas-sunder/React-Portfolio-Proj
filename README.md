Project Overview:

  - Led a team of three students for capstone, utilizing GitHub for a collaborative and successful project outcome.
  - Programmed an Arduino Arc Fault detection system and mobile app utilizing MySQL for real-time notifications.

Project Challenges:

In my role as team leader, I assumed various responsibilities, including documenting meeting minutes during our weekly meetings and overseeing the project and team using the waterfall method to meet project deadlines effectively. Additionally, I undertook the software development aspects of the project, which involved coding the Arduino to update a database and send SMS and mobile notifications upon detecting an Arc fault. Furthermore, I developed a mobile application to track notifications and facilitate synchronization of multiple arc fault detectors installed on various breakers in old homes.

These responsibilities allowed me to develop comprehensive leadership and technical skills while ensuring the successful execution of the project. Through effective coordination and hands-on development, I contributed to the project's overall success and gained valuable experience in project management and software development. Moreover, drawing from my minor in management, I was able to apply strategic planning and organizational skills, further enhancing my contributions to the project.
