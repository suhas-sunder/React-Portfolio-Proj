      ["At the outset of this project, I encountered a significant challenge: while I was well-versed in JavaScript, React, Express, and PostgreSQL, I had no experience with some of the project requirements or technologies such as Prisma ORM or Remix. During the interview for this position, I was frank about my limitations, but was given a chance to hit the ground running. This presented a unique chance for me to step out of my comfort zone and quickly familiarize myself with new technologies on the job, all while ensuring timely delivery of project deliverables. Embracing this challenge head on has resulted in personal and professional growth as I have greatly expanded my skills in full-stack web application development.",
        "While I cannot disclose specific details about the hurdles I faced, this project was extensive and multifaceted. It involved developing interfaces for Landlord, Tenant, and Realtor accounts with complex integrations to facilitate effective communication and information sharing. Some technical challenges included debugging errors produced by code on the client, server, and external API, as well as designing database relationships and schema for proper information storage and flow. One crucial aspect involved ensuring that access to secure pages was restricted to authorized individuals based on account type. Navigating these challenges allowed me to further hone my programming skills, particularly in full-stack application development, problem-solving, and debugging. I am eager to apply these lessons to future projects and continue pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve as a software developer.",

      "Initially, I encountered an issue where loading too many characters at once caused the application to crash. To resolve this, I implemented a solution to limit the amount of text rendered within the text area.",
      "Another challenge was hiding lines of text when the user completed typing more than two lines or showing hidden lines of text when user held the delete key. Initially, I attempted to estimate the width of each character using the Roboto font but encountered discrepancies due to rounding errors. To address this, I switched to a Monotype font and assigned a fixed width to each character, ensuring consistent line lengths and facilitating the addition or removal of lines based on user input.",
      "However, creating a responsive design without compromising the existing logic was another hurdle. I had to calculate the maximum length of each line based on the current screen width, dynamically adjusting the displayed text to maintain a maximum of two lines while accommodating varying screen sizes. This involved recalculating line lengths whenever the screen size changed to ensure the interface remained functional across different devices and resolutions.",
      "I encountered an issue where users could exploit the system by holding down a key, such as the space bar, to achieve a high score without completing the test properly. Initially, I considered implementing a modal pop-up to disqualify the test and prompt a reset when a user held any key for too long. However, I found this approach intrusive and detrimental to the user experience.", "Instead, I opted to listen to every key input and programmed the system to reject input, except for backspace, once a long keydown event was detected until a keyup event occurred. While this approach partially addressed the issue, it introduced a minor lag that affected the accuracy of user input, resulting in an unfair test experience.",
      "After exploring various solutions, I discovered that comparing the held keydown input to the last keyup input effectively prevented users from holding down keys while allowing normal typing behavior. This adjustment restored the test's functionality and prevented users from exploiting the system.",
      "Throughout the project, I encountered numerous challenges that required meticulous attention to detail and innovative problem-solving. Despite the app's seemingly simple appearance, it presented a myriad of complexities that significantly enhanced my problem-solving and programming skills. From creating a real-world application hosted live to implementing features such as manipulating text according to test difficulty presets, score tracking, and serving media and JSON files via Cloudflare R2 API, these experiences have broadened my technical capabilities and deepened my understanding of the fundamentals of programming, the nuances of using React and related technologies, user-centric design, and software development best practices."],

        "I encountered an issue when I pasted my project page URL (Eg: /projects/dobsonpartners) directly into the search bar, the page would load with a 404 not found error thrown by Netlify, my hosting provider. Netlify would redirect all pages back to the home page instead of handling routing through my single page application, via an index.html file, using React Router. The solution was to add a _redirects.txt file to my application so that Netlify knows to redirect all routes back to the index.html file, allowing React Router to handle the route correctly.",

Similarly, to enhance type inference and reduce debugging time, I introduced TypeScript to the project.",
